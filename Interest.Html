       <h4>  What is Anime? </h4> 
        <p> Anime is a type of animation originally from Japan that has, in recent years, become popular in western countries. Being simply a medium, anime ranges widely in subject matter and content, so there is probably an anime for anybody who cares to look.

       <h2> Genres </h2>
       <p>Anime, like any form of entertainment can be broken in genres that describe the qualities of each show. This will be a list of some of the most common genres.</p>
       <h6>note: there are A LOT of anime genres, this is not meant to be a comprehensive list, just a list of the most common/popular</h6>
          <h3> Shounen </h3>
          <p> Shounen: Technically speaking, Shounen isn't a  genre, its a magazine. Weekly Shounen Jump is a magazine in Japan, where every issue contains a chapter of a 
          particular manga. This genre is named after Shounen Jump due to the popularity of the manga (and later anime) contained within the magazine. This anime are included, 
          but not limited too, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto, My Hero Academia, Attack on Titan, and on and on. Now, Shounen Jump being a large company, not every anime the 
          produce falls under the "shounen" genre. All of the anime I listed above do qualify as shounen, though Attack on Titan is up for debate. 

          Shounen anime are characterized by generally being about fighting. The most common type is one on one martial arts though there can be different or more general 
          mediums such as war, magic, or sometimes games. The color pallets of these shows are also bright, making them superficially similar to kids cartoons from the west. 
          Some shounen are marketed towards children and young teens, but many are meant for older audiences. The protagonists of these shows are frequently aloof and chaotic, 
          often being compared to children, though like children they never mean any harm and do the right thing when its really important. The power systems of these anime are 
          also rather varied, but most of them involve some form of supernatural energy that the protagonist and his allies (and enemies) can utilize to perform superhuman feats.
          The most well known example of this is Goku, who uses "ki" to perform various energy attacks and have superhuman fighting ability. The strength of these characters is 
          frequently directly related to their emotions and mental state, their will to fight, love of their friends, etc. Possibly the most famous aspect of shounen anime is 
          the ability of protagonists to win at the last second after being cheered on by friends or remembering "what is important". While this trope appears in many anime, 
          it is most pronounced in Shounen. </p>

<p> Examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Ball Z</li>
<li>My Hero Academia</li>
<li>Naruto</li>
</ul>

<p>It's worth mentioning a few genres that could be considered shonen but are generally considered their own category</p>
<dl>
<li>Mecha: Named after the giant robots central to the genre, mecha anime are shows in which people pilot large robots 
to fight each other and/or monsters, similar to the movie series Pacific Rim </li>

<li>Isekai: Where one or more characters from Earth (frequently Japan) get teleported to to a different world, usually with fantasy elements such as magic, monsters, and stats. 
The character(s) usually weren't very successful on Earth but become immensely powerful in the new world and have to defeat a dark lord of some kind.</li>

            it as a challenge, make small changes, and test your page often.</p>
